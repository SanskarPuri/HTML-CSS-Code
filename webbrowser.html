      <p>Water is a transparent, tasteless and odorless liquid, essential for life.<br>
      The chemical formula of water is,

      It composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. It exists in three states:
      <ul>
        <strong>
        <li>solid</li>
        <li>liquid</li>
        <li>gas</li>
        </strong>
      </ul>
      It is a universal solvent, meaning it can dissolve a waide range of substances.<br>
      Covering about 71% of Earth's surface, water is crucial for biological processes, acting as a solvent and helping regulate room temprature in living organisms.<br>
      <strong>⚫Chemical and Physical Properties</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Composition: </strong>Each water molecule consists of two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded to one oxygen atom.</li><br>
        <li><strong>States of matter: </strong>At standard temperatures, it is a liquid, but it can also exist as a solid (ice), which forms at 0°C (32°F), and a gas (water vapor), which forms at 100°C (212°F). </li><br>
        <li><strong>Polarity: </strong>Water is a polar molecule, enabling strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, which contributes to its unique physical properties. </li><br>
      </ul>
      <strong>⚫Biological Importance</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Essential for life: </strong>Water is vital for all known life forms, acting as a solvent for biological processes within living organisms. </li><br>
        <li><strong>Temprature Regulation: </strong>Its high specific heat capacity helps organisms regulate their body temperature by absorbing and releasing large amounts of heat with little change in temperature. </li><br>
        <li><strong>Hydration: </strong> Organisms, including humans, require regular water intake to replace water lost through processes like sweating and digestion. </li>
      </ul>

      <section class="distribution">
      <strong>⚫Distribution on Earth</strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Global Abundance: </strong>Water is the main constituent of the Earth's hydrosphere, covering approximately 71% of the planet's surface in oceans, lakes, and rivers. </li><br>
        <li><strong>Natural Cycle: </strong> It plays a key role in the water cycle, naturally moving between the clouds and the Earth's surface as rain, rivers, lakes, and oceans. </li>
      </ul>
